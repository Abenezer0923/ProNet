# Username Editor - Quick Guide

## How to Change Your Username

### Step 1: Go to Edit Profile
Visit: https://pro-net-ten.vercel.app/profile/edit

### Step 2: Find "Profile URL" Section
Look for the section that shows:
```
Profile URL
pro-net-ten.vercel.app/in/your-current-username
```

### Step 3: Enter New Username
Type your desired username in the input field

**Rules**:
- Lowercase letters only (a-z)
- Numbers allowed (0-9)
- Hyphens allowed (-)
- 3-30 characters
- No spaces or special characters

### Step 4: Check Availability
The system automatically checks if your username is available:

**Available** ✓
```
Username: [new-username] ✓ [Update]
✓ Username is available!
```

**Taken** ✗
```
Username: [taken-name] ✗
✗ Username is already taken
```

**Invalid** ⚠️
```
Username: [ab]
✗ Username must be at least 3 characters
```

### Step 5: Click Update
When you see the green checkmark ✓, click the "Update" button

### Step 6: Automatic Redirect
You'll be redirected to your new profile URL:
```
https://pro-net-ten.vercel.app/in/your-new-username
```

## Examples

### Good Usernames
```
✅ john-doe
✅ jane-smith-123
✅ developer2024
✅ abenezer-getachew
✅ tech-enthusiast
```

### Bad Usernames (Will Be Auto-Fixed)
```
John-Doe → john-doe (uppercase converted)
user name → username (spaces removed)
user@123 → user123 (special chars removed)
```

### Invalid Usernames
```
❌ ab (too short - minimum 3)
❌ this-is-way-too-long-username-that-exceeds-the-limit (too long - max 30)
```

## Tips

1. **Choose Wisely**: Your username is part of your professional profile URL
2. **Keep It Simple**: Easy to remember and share
3. **Professional**: Use your name or professional identity
4. **Unique**: Make it stand out but professional
5. **Consistent**: Use the same username across platforms if possible

## What Happens When You Change Username?

1. **Old URL stops working**: `/in/old-username` → 404
2. **New URL becomes active**: `/in/new-username` → Your profile
3. **All links update**: Dashboard, connections, etc. use new URL
4. **Instant change**: No waiting period

## Troubleshooting

### "Username is already taken"
- Try adding numbers: `john-doe-123`
- Try variations: `john-m-doe`
- Try year: `john-doe-2024`

### "Username must be at least 3 characters"
- Add more characters
- Minimum is 3, recommended 5+

### "Update button not showing"
- Make sure username is different from current
- Make sure username is available (green checkmark)
- Make sure username is valid format

### "Failed to update username"
- Check internet connection
- Try again in a few seconds
- Make sure you're logged in
